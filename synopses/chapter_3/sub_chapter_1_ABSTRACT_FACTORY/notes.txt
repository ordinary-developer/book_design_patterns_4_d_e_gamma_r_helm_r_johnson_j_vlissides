 abstract factory
 ################

 base
 ====

 - a factory may be in a single instance (singleton)
 - a factory may be abstract
 - a factory may be with realized virtual methods
   (factory methods)

 often this pattern may be implemented as a set of factory methods

 addition
 ========

  a factory can use a prototype pattern
  (it (factory) can be initialized with an object and then
   it (factory) can create a copy of this object)
